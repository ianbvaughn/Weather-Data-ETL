# Weather Data ETL
## Version 1.0

This project grabs hourly weather data for San Francisco, cleans it, and writes it to a database.

## System Requirements

After cloning the repo to your local machine, you will need to provide to create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and provide the following values:

```python
OPEN_WEATHER_API='<YOUR_API_KEY>'
AIRFLOW__API_AUTH__JWT_SECRET='<YOUR_JWT_SECRET>'
```

The `OPEN_WEATHER_API` key will be generated by creating an Open Weather API account, and signing up for the free tier of service, which allows for a certain number of calls per month.

The `AIRFLOW__API_AUTH__JWT_SECRET` is found in the `airflow.cfg` file, which gets generated when you go to build the image for the first time.

## How it works

This project is built Apache Airflow and Postgres. The ETL DAG runs **daily** as follows:

1. Grab hourly weather data using OpenWeather API.
2. Use pandas to grab datetime at hourly interval, current temperature (c) and 'feels like' temperature (c).
3. Write the dataframe to a Postgres container.
